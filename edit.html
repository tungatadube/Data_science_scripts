        <li>In the section before this, we learn that a current carrying conductor has an associated magnetic field around it.</li>
        <li>What would happen if a magnetic field around a current carrying conductor interacts with other magnetic fields?</li>
        <li>Very interesting and important phenomena develop depending on how the current carrying conductor is mechanically fashioned around such a field.</li>
        <li>From this interaction a host of devices are born; drills, DVD players, computer’s hard disks and a collection of other components with related movements that arise from such an interaction.</li>

        <h6>Method:</h6>
        <ol>
        <li>Hold a permanent horse shoe magnet to the wire as shown.</li>
        <li>Allow someone to close the switch</li>
        <li>Observe what happens when the switch is closed</li>
        <li>Increase the current before closing the switch again</li>
        <li>Observe the magnitude of the motion of the conductor</li>
        <li>Reverse the direction of the current (interchange the positive or negative terminals of your supply.) before closing the switch</li>
        <li>Observe the direction of the motion of the wire</li>
        <li>Use two magnets stacked one on top of the other before closing the switch.</li>
        <li>Observe the magnitude of motion of the wire</li>
        <li>Reverse the poles of the magnet</li>
        <li>Observe the direction of motion of the wire</li>
        <li>Change the angle of the current carrying conductor in the magnetic field.</li>
        <li>Observe the magnitude of the motion of the conductor.</li>
        </ol>
        <h6>Expected Observations:</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>Your investigation should show that:</li>
        <li><strong>The force moving the conductor is increased</strong> <strong>by</strong> ,</li>
        <li>Increasing the current</li>
        <li>Using a stronger magnet</li>
        <li><strong>The direction of the force is reversed if;</strong></li>
        <li>The direction of the current is reversed</li>
        <li>The direction of the magnetic field is reversed</li>
        <li><strong>The force depends on the angle between the wire and the magnetic field. The force is,</strong></li>
        <li>Greatest when the wire is perpendicular to the magnetic field</li>
        <li>Zero when the wire is parallel to the magnetic field lines</li>
        <li><strong>The direction of the force is always at right angles to the wire and the field lines.</strong></li>
        <li>The direction of the force can be worked out from the direction of the field lines and the current using a rule known as Fleming’s left hand rule.</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Conclusion:</h6>
        <ul>
        <li>There is a force acting on a current carrying conductor when it is placed in a magnetic field.</li>
        <li>The direction of this force is given by using Fleming’s left hand detailed below<strong></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Fleming’s Left hand rule (motor rule)</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Fleming’s left hand rule is stated as follows,</li>
        </ul>
        <q><strong>Hold your left fingers with the First finger pointing in the direction of the Field and the second finger pointing in the direction of the current, the Thumb points in the direction of the motion of the current carrying conductor.</strong></q><br /> <br />

        <ul>
        <li>So far we have learnt that a magnetic field exists in a current carrying conductor. <strong></strong></li>
        <li>We learnt that such a field also has a direction given by the right hand grip rule.<strong></strong></li>
        <li>In general <strong>like currents attract </strong>(direction of current flow) and <strong>unlike currents repel </strong>as shown in the diagram below.</li>

        <ul>
        <li>The reason is due the direction of the field in between the wires.</li>
        <li>If the direction of current flow is not the same the wires will repel as this happens when you apply the right hand grip rule to the first diagram.</li>
        <li>For the first wire the field points <strong>downwards </strong>in between the wires, application of the same rule on the second wire shows that its field also points <strong>downwards</strong> in the same region.</li>
        <li>This alone causes the magnetic fields to repel since the same poles will be prevailing at that particular space and time.</li>

        <h3>Application of the magnetic field of a current</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>We apply the magnetic effect of a current to many everyday instances. The motion of the current carrying conductor allows electric bells to produce sound, motors to move and a host of other everyday examples.</li>
        <li>We look at the workings of an electric bell and the motor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The Electric bell</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Having understood how a magnetic field is developed around a solenoid we delve into a simple application of a solenoid system, the electric bell. An electric bell is shown in Fig 10.2.7 below.</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><img src="https://www.rdl.co.zw/public/uploads/content/O%20LEVEL%20PHYSICS/10.0%20ELECTROMAGNETISM/10.2%20Force%20on%20current%20carrying%20conductor/Images/8.Fig%2010.2.7.jpg" alt="8.Fig 10.2.7.jpg (153 KB)" class="img-responsive" /> <label>Fig 10.2.7: The electric bell</label><br /><br />
        <ul>
        <li>Closing switch S, causes a current to flow from E.</li>
        <li>When current flows, the U shaped solenoid is induced with a magnetic field, causing its iron core to be magnetic hence attracting the iron arm A to move upwards about the pivot P.</li>
        <li>When the arm moves upwards it strikes the bell B, disconecting the circuit at T.</li>
        <li>Current ceases to flow in the solenoid making the magnetic field to disappear.</li>
        <li>The spring arm T then falls back , when it completes the circuit it is pulled up again striking the bell again.</li>
        <li>This occurs many times in one second thereby causing a continuous sound to be heard.</li>

        <ul>
        <li>A d.c motor is a device that converts direct current (electrical energy) into mechanical energy.</li>
        <li>In order to understand the operating principle of d.c motor, we need to first look into its constructional features.</li>
        <li>The split ring allows the direction of current to change depending on the position of the arm in the magnetic field</li>
        <li>The permanent magnets introduce a magnetic field that will interact with the magnetic field from the current carrying coil.</li>
        <li>Fleming’s left hand rule will give the direction of the motion of the coil in the magnetic field.</li>
        <li>In the arm<strong> dc</strong> the current flows from d to c, applying Fleming’s left hand rule to this arm will show that it is under a force that causes it to move down wards.</li>
        <li>Similarly the arm <strong>ba </strong>has a current that flows from b to a, applying Fleming’s left hand rule will show that the arm has a motion that moves it upwards.</li>
        <li>The totality of these two motions will combine to cause the coil to rotate about its fixed axis in a clockwise sense in this case.</li>
        <li>Reversing the direction of the current or the magnetic field will cause the motion to go anticlockwise. (You may have seen hand drills that have a switch to reverse the motion of the drill-bit).</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h6>Solution</h6>
        1) The coil rotates in an anticlockwise sense. Applying Fleming’s left hand rule on the arms of the coil will show that the coil will turn anticlockwise.</div>
